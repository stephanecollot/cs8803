This is an open letter to all farmers in Yakima County:   If you do not want another tax shoved down your throat that is hard to swallow, I would urge everyone who can to attend the storm water runoff open house at the Yakima Convention Center (10 North Eighth Street) on Wednesday, Sept. 22. The doors will open at 6:30 p.m. The question and answer session begins at 7 p.m.   Most of the farmers do not have a storm water runoff problem. But we will be taxed anyway if we do not act now.   /s/ Mark D. Clemmens, Alderwood
