Realizing that the first day of school can be exciting and scary for the parents of kindergarten children, the Alderwood Parent Information Resource Center is hosting a series of parent orientation meetings beginning Thursday, Aug. 19.   The meetings, to be held at each of Alderwood School District's elementary schools, will cover such topics as the importance of attendance and tardiness. Other topics will include how to prepare children for school and monitoring of their homework, according to Yesenia Rodriguez of the Parent Resource Center.   She said issues, such as bus routes, student insurance and lunches, will also be covered.   The first orientation meeting will be held Thursday, Aug. 19, for parents of Washington Elementary School kindergartners at 6 p.m.   Tuesday, Aug. 24, the parent meeting will be held at Pioneer Elementary School, also at 6 p.m. The parents of Outlook Elementary School kindergarten students are invited to meet Thursday, Aug. 26, at 6 p.m.   The meetings are being provided jointly by the Washington State Migrant Council, Alderwood's Promise and the Parent Information Resource Center.
