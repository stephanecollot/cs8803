Mayor Rex Luthor announced today he would sign a contract worth an estimated $1 million to purchase touch-screen voting machines from Sequoia Voting Systems.  The machines will be installed in Alderwood and some surrounding regions in time for the 2004 election, he said. He also issued an order that punch-card voting machines will no longer be used after Sept. 1.
