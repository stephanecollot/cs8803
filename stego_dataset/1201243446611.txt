FactSheet: Overview of South American Terrorist Organizations 

United Self-Defense Forces/Group of Colombia (AUC–Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia)
Description 
The AUC—commonly referred to as the paramilitaries—is an umbrella organization formed in April 1997 to consolidate most local and regional paramilitary groups each with the mission to protect economic interests and combat insurgents locally. The AUC_supported by economic elites, drug traffickers, and local communities lacking effective government security_claims its primary objective is to protect its sponsors from insurgents. The AUC now asserts itself as a regional and national counterinsurgent force. It is adequately equipped and armed and reportedly pays its members a monthly salary. AUC political leader Carlos Castaño has claimed 70 percent of the AUC's operational costs are financed with drug-related earnings, the rest from "donations" from its sponsors.
Activities 
AUC operations vary from assassinating suspected insurgent supporters to engaging guerrilla combat units. Colombian National Combat operations generally consist of raids and ambushes directed against suspected insurgents. The AUC generally avoids engagements with government security forces and actions against US personnel or interests.
Strength 
Estimated 6000 to 8150, including former military and insurgent personnel.
Location/Areas of Operation 
AUC forces are strongest in the northwest in Antioquia, Córdoba, Sucre, and Bolívar Departments. Since 1999, the group demonstrated a growing presence in other northern and southwestern departments. Clashes between the AUC and the FARC insurgents in Putumayo in 2000 demonstrated the range of the AUC to contest insurgents throughout Colombia.
External Aid 
None.

National Liberation Army (ELN)—Colombia
Description
Marxist insurgent group formed in 1965 by urban intellectuals inspired by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. Began a dialogue with Colombian officials in 1999 following a campaign of mass kidnappings—each involving at least one US citizen—to demonstrate its strength and continuing viability and force the Pastrana administration to negotiate. Peace talks between Bogotá and the ELN, started in 1999, continued sporadically through 2001 until Bogota broke them off in August, but resumed in Havana, Cuba, by year's end. 
Activities
Kidnapping, hijacking, bombing, extortion, and guerrilla war. Modest conventional military capability. Annually conducts hundreds of kidnappings for ransom, often targeting foreign employees of large corporations, especially in the petroleum industry. Frequently assaults energy infrastructure and has inflicted major damage on pipelines and the electric distribution network.
Strength
Approximately 3,000-5,000 armed combatants and an unknown number of active supporters.
Location/Area of Operation
Mostly in rural and mountainous areas of north, northeast, and southwest Colombia, and Venezuela border regions.
External Aid
Cuba provides some medical care and political consultation.

Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)
Description
Established in 1964 as the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party, the FARC is Colombia's oldest, largest, most capable, and best-equipped Marxist insurgency. The FARC is governed by a secretariat, led by septuagenarian Manuel Marulanda, a.k.a. "Tirofijo," and six others, including senior military commander Jorge Briceno, a.k.a. "Mono Jojoy." Organized along military lines and includes several urban fronts. In 2001, the group continued a slow-moving peace negotiation process with the Pastrana Administration that has gained the group several concessions, including a demilitarized zone used as a venue for negotiations. 
Activities
Bombings, murder, kidnapping, extortion, hijacking, as well as guerrilla and conventional military action against Colombian political, military, and economic targets. In March 1999 the FARC executed three US Indian rights activists on Venezuelan territory after it kidnapped them in Colombia. Foreign citizens often are targets of FARC kidnapping for ransom. Has well-documented ties to narcotics traffickers, principally through the provision of armed protection.
Strength
Approximately 9,000-12,000 armed combatants and an unknown number of supporters, mostly in rural areas.
Location/Area of Operation
Colombia with some activities—extortion, kidnapping, logistics, and R&R—in Venezuela, Panama, and Ecuador.
External Aid
Cuba provides some medical care and political consultation.

Porvenir Luminoso (Shining Future, or SF) 
Description
Former farm worker Francisco Dorado formed Porvenir Luminoso in the late 1980s, and his teachings created the foundation of SF's militant reformist doctrine. His work is being carried on by the charismatic Armando Catalano, the new leader of SF in the 2000s. In the 1990s PL became a formidable force in  South America; although Parazuelan military blame them for the deaths of 5000 persons since Shining Future took up arms. Its stated goal is to destroy existing Parazuelan institutions and replace them with a neo-marxist peasant revolutionary regime. It also opposes any influence by foreign governments, as well as by other Latin American guerrilla groups, especially the Xiaan Compacto Revolutionary Movement (MRCX). In 2002, the Parazuelan National Police thwarted an SF attack against "an American objective", possibly the US Embassy, when they arrested two SF cell members. 
Activities 
Conducted indiscriminate bombing campaigns and selective assassinations. Detonated explosives at diplomatic missions of several countries in Parazuela in 1990, including an attempt to car bomb the US Embassy in December. Parazuela authorities continued operations against the SF in 2003 in the countryside, where the SL conducted operations. 
Strength 
Membership is unknown but estimated to be 200 armed militants. SL's strength has been vastly diminished by arrests and desertions.
Location/Area of Operation 
Parazuela, with most activity in rural areas. 
External Aid 
Unknown.

Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) 
Description
Traditional Marxist-Leninist revolutionary movement formed in 1983 from remnants of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left, a Peruvian insurgent group active in the 1960s. Aims to establish a Marxist regime and to rid Peru of all imperialist elements (primarily US and Japanese influence). Peru's counterterrorist program has diminished the group's ability to carry out terrorist attacks, and the MRTA has suffered from infighting, the imprisonment or deaths of senior leaders, and loss of leftist support. In 2001, several MRTA members remained imprisoned in Bolivia. 
Activities
Previously conducted bombings, kidnappings, ambushes, and assassinations, but recent activity has fallen drastically. In December 1996, 14 MRTA members occupied the Japanese Ambassador's residence in Lima and held 72 hostages for more than four months. Peruvian forces stormed the residence in April 1997 rescuing all but one of the remaining hostages and killing all 14 group members, including the remaining leaders. The group has not conducted a significant terrorist operation since and appears more focused on obtaining the release of imprisoned MRTA members. 
Strength
Believed to be no more than 100 members, consisting largely of young fighters who lack leadership skills and experience.
Location/Area of Operation
Peru with supporters throughout Latin America and Western Europe. Controls no territory.
External Aid
None.
