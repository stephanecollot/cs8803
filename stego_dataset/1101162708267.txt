Grizzly grid game against West Valley at home Friday
Date Published to Web: 9/29/2004

Alderwood Athletic Director Bill Daley doesn't want Grizzly football fans trekking to West Valley this Friday, to find an empty field.   Daley said some of the schedules that were initially distributed at the beginning of the season listed this coming Friday night's football game being played on the Rams' home field.   "That isn't the case," said Daley.   He reiterated that the game will actually be played on the Alderwood field. Game time is slated for 7:30 p.m.   The Grizzlies will be looking to knock off West Valley. A victory would square Alderwood's record at 1-1 in the conference standings.
