Date Published to Web: 1/15/2004

At this past Monday night's meeting, the Alderwood City Council entered into an agreement with the Humane Society of Central Washington to provide animal control services in 2004.   "We have enjoyed the positive relationship with the City of Alderwood and hope to continue that relationship in the future," Humane Society of Central Washington Executive Director Alan Landvoy wrote in a report presented to Council.   The Humane Society asked for a 3 percent increase over last year's fee for services in 2004. The amount the Humane Society asked Council to approve, which it did, in 2004 was $1,815 per month, or $21,786 per year.   In 2003, the Humane Society shelter housed more than 11,000 animals, 504 of which came from within the Alderwood city limits. Dogs accounted for the largest number of animals housed at the Humane Society. In 2003, the Humane Society catered to 290 dogs from the Alderwood area, 132 of which were euthenized. Alderwood area cats were also a frequent visitor to the Humane Shelter. There were 178 cats from the Alderwood area taken to the Yakima shelter in 2003, 125 of which were euthenized.   Of the 504 Alderwood area animals taken to the Humane Society shelter, 259 of them were killed. The shelter did manage to find homes for 108 of the animals, 98 of which were dogs.   Under the terms of the agreement, the Humane Society agrees to provide at least 20 hours of service within the Alderwood city limits. The Humane Society also agrees to pick up all injured or dead animals as part of the contract.   The city will be pay $6 per day for any dogs housed at the Humane Society that are needed in criminal investigation cases.   In the event of extra patrol needed, the city will pay the Humane Society $25 per hour.   The contract also states the city will keep all of the money from fines.
