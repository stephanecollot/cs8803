Council approves interlocal agreement with Bellevue
This past Monday night, the Alderwood City Council approved an interlocal agreement with the City of Bellevue for the purchase of city supplies.
Alderwood City Manager Tom Rockford said Bellevue officials approached the city about joining a group of other cities that would be able to bid on supplies and services.
"It does not bind us," said Rockford. "It simply is an opportunity."
Councilman Tom Seeger thought the idea Rockford presented was outstanding, but wanted to keep local merchants in mind first as long as they were within 5 percent of the asking price.
The Council agreed with Seeger's suggestion and asked city staff to keep local merchants in mind when looking at supply orders. Mayor Rex Luthor reminded Council that 1 percent of all sales tax revenue goes back into city coffers.
