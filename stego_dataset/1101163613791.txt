Alderwood school superintendent puts vehicle bids on hold
Date Published to Web: 2/27/2004

The Alderwood School Board last night approved a bid to purchase two vehicles for the Migrant Student Records System (MSRS) program.   Alderwood School District Superintendent Dr. Aaron Bones Friday morning, though, put a hold on the bid. Bones was unable to be at Thursday night's school board meeting because of a personal commitment. Bones said until he can get some more clarification on what happened with the bid process for the vehicles, he is putting the issue on hold.   "(The) bid (is) on hold until we can review it with legal counsel and the state auditor," said Bones Friday morning.   The issue concerns the district purchasing two vehicles for the MSRS program, which would in turn lease the cars from the school district. Alderwood School District is the fiscal agent for the MSRS program. MSRS program workers travel all over the state to aid migrant students. MSRS Director Lee Campos wants to purchase the vehicles because it will be less expensive than paying his staff a mileage stipend.   The school district received three bids for the vehicles, one from Toyota of Yakima, another from Tom Denchel Ford and a third from the state vehicle bid process through Harris Ford of Lynnwood.   The bid from Toyota of Yakima for each vehicle was $20,195. Denchel's had a significantly less bid of $14,212 per car while the state bid from Harris Ford was $13,429.   The school board went with the recommendation of Executive Director of Finance Dave Plesha to purchase two, 2004 Camrys from Toyota of Yakima.   Bones said Friday morning he will be reviewing the entire bid process for the vehicles again before any final decision is made.
