ZILLAH - It is fitting that paintings with titles like "Space Winds" and "Winds of Change" should be on display in a north Zillah gallery named for the area's "good air."   The paintings, distinctive in their blended movements of grays, yellows, blues and whites, are the creative endeavors of Yakima Valley artist Elena Leonardo.   Leonardo, whose work has been shown in galleries throughout Europe during the last 20 years, is finishing up a show at the Bonair Winery gallery on Bonair Road. She expects to hold a new opening in Seattle in the near future.   

For the time being, she is enjoying the winery's visitor's reactions to her work, which is largely centered on a Greek mythological theme.   The use of astrology and mythology has a prominent place in her work as she combines themes such as Helio's son's tragic experience with Helio's chariot steeds.   "I've always had a need to express my feeling about the universe in a logical way, based on my life's experiences," she said.   

Leonardo, who loves to add an underlying element of storytelling in her work, enjoys working with concepts like supernovas and exploring the effects of weightlessness. The power of her feelings resonates from each of the 12 paintings currently on display at the Zillah winery.   

The current show closes Sept. 2.   Bonair Winery, at 500 S. Bonair Rd. on the Zillah Fruit Loop, is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
